# Class Component & Typescript React App: PERN Client Side

## Welcome to the "What's on Tap" App! 
"What's on Tap" is a full stack CRUD app for those who love travel and a good glass of beer. Travelers want to be apart of the "local experience" and there is no best way to find fellowship and learn about the locals than by going to the local pub. Click the link to find the [server](https://github.com/KKoehlin/Red_ProjectServer.git).

## Getting Started
1. Clone the [client](https://github.com/KKoehlin/Red_Client_Final.git) repo
2. Run `npm install` to install the packages
3. Run `npm start` to start the client side
